# Manual
These are the instructions for the SSN Validator script.
These assume the program is already running in a console window.
## Detecting the validity of an SSN
To detect the validity of a Social Security Number (SSN), type it into the console window after the prompt, and press the `enter` key on your keyboard.
The program will then tell you if the SSN is valid or not.
## Exiting the program
To exit the program, instead of typing an SSN into the console window, type `exit`. The console will then stop the process (and potentially also exit).
