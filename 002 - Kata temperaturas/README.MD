# Temperature API
This python module offers an API to work with temperatures on other python scripts.

## Installation Steps
_Usually you would go about this by somehow publishing it to the python package index and then doing `pip install <packagename>` and then import the package as needed, however this is not so fancy. [This resource](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-upload-your-python-package-to-pypi-de1b363a1b3) goes more in depth, but this doesn't solve anything in a new way, so I'm not publishing it._

Just drag and drop the module file where you plan on using it, then import the Temperature class where you needed as regular.

## Instruction Manual
This program has a user manual with instructions on how to properly use the script. It contains various snippets on how to perform various tasks.
Refer to the [user manual](docs/MANUAL.MD).

## Details
* Temperatures are initialized as Kelvin by default.
* Temperature products and quotients don't make any sense, but are supported nonetheless.

## About the Homework
This package is done thrice because it is a homework assignment; one per day.
